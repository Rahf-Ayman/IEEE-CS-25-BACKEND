> **What is a Database and why does it exist?**
> 
> A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed electronically.  
> It allows users to efficiently store, retrieve, update, and manage data.
> 
> Before databases, people stored data in files and spreadsheets,  
> but as data grew, these methods became inefficient. Databases solve several problems, including:
> 
> - **Efficient Data Management** – Databases allow quick searching, sorting, and updating of data.
> - **Data Integrity & Consistency** – Ensures that data is accurate and consistent across multiple users.
> - **Security** – Databases provide user authentication and access control to protect sensitive information.
> - **Scalability** – They can handle large volumes of data and grow with application needs.
> - **Data Relationships** – With relational databases, data can be structured in a way that prevents redundancy and maintains relationships.

> **What is SQL?**
> 
> SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to store, manage,  
> and manipulate data in relational databases.

> **What are the 5 most famous databases in the world now, and why?**
> 
> - **Oracle Database** – Oracle Database is renowned for its robustness and scalability,  
>   making it a preferred choice for large enterprises handling extensive and complex data operations.
> - **MySQL** – As an open-source relational DBMS, MySQL powers a substantial portion of websites globally.
> - **Microsoft SQL Server** – Developed by Microsoft, this relational DBMS is favored by many  
>   organizations for its seamless integration with other Microsoft products.
> - **PostgreSQL** – PostgreSQL has experienced significant growth due to its advanced features,  
>   extensibility, and standards compliance, making it a popular choice among developers.
> - **MongoDB** – A NoSQL database designed for handling large volumes of unstructured data,  
>   making it ideal for applications requiring flexible and scalable data storage.
